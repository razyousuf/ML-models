# ML-models

### 1. 15 Most Commonly Used ML Algorithms in Python
Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are computational methods that enable systems to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks without being explicitly programmed. These algorithms form the backbone of various applications, from image recognition to natural language processing. In this presentation, we'll explore 15 commonly used ML algorithms, their applications, and implementations using Python.

### 2. Visualised representaiton of some of the most popular Clustering Techniques 
In this presentation, we'll explore and compare models' performance on random number of clusters (Circular and Non-Circular data points).
